description: I have a specific interest in reverse engineering malware and a knack for recognizing patterns. My fascination with understanding the intricacies of malware has led me to delve deep into its mechanisms, origins, and impacts. I believe that understanding a problem is the first step towards solving it, which fuels my passion for cybersecurity and reverse engineering. I am interactive and my intent is finding solutions. My perseverance is to connecting and empower consumers with todayâ€™s tech while protecting their digital assets from threat actors.
