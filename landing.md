					<h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
				</header>
				<p>

<p>Creating software, providing solutions, and teaching others of the intricacies of a system is my intent. By studying Cybersecurity, I educate others in fundamentals in computing and secure practices. I am aware of the importance in confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. Maintaining user roles and permissions is important for auditing purposes and I continue to enjoy this line of work. In my spare time when playing mind challenging games, I can explore more and find areas of improvement. I'd enjoy protecting and securing technical services on a global aspect in order to protect users from malicious activities or exploits. Maintaining services, development, and access control is important in today's world.  The potential of AI or extensive networking tools to maintain network security and Quality of Service is important going forward. Artificial Intelligence is a strong tool that can be used with or even against Cybersecurity. </p>

<p>When experiencing technology solutions at SOFWERX, I became involved with real time threat analysis. With the experience as a Data Science Intern, utilizing Machine Learning to identify anomalous or adversarial actions based on packet data is one of many approaches a Cyber Analyst can take to identify threats. The internship brings me such a unique environment with lots to explore. </p></p>
